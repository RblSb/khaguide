# Last Thoughts

This guide presents a working game, but that doesn't mean it's "finished".

The game has no title screen, it simply says "GAME OVER" when the gameplay hasn't started. This is authentic to the original, but not up to modern standards - it could present GAME OVER temporarily, then go to a high scores screen, show instructions, present an attract-mode demo, etc.

Multiplayer is part of the original Canyon Bomber game, but it's not included here. Fixing this will require some changes to the UI, graphics, and sound routines.

The game is unforgivingly strict in a way that is typical of 1970's arcade games; a modern version might consider alternatives to "lives", end the level before clearing every last rock, or change some aspects of the bomb drop and how it's lined up.

The gameplay works on the small scale, but doesn't expand or unfold. It could use a longer-term focus like upgrading your plane, pre-designed puzzles with ingenious solutions, a second phase which uses the cleared canyon in a different way, different scenarios for bombing, etc.

And, of course, the graphics and sound could always be done with more detail.
