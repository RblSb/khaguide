# Kha's First Game Jam

This guide is intended to give you a "real-world" introduction to problems and techniques found in game programming, as well as the Kha APIs and how to use them in games. A simple but finished 2D game is presented with its full source code at each stage of development, from the early drawing routines to the final polish.

Its intended audience is existing programmers who don't necessarily know game programming or the Haxe language, and experienced game programmers who would like to see a whole project workflow in action.
